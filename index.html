  <p>PNW Forestry is a Washington-based nonprofit dedicated to restoring the region’s native ecosystems 
     and protecting biodiversity from the growing threat of invasive species. Our mission is to empower 
     communities, educate the public, and mobilize volunteers to combat environmental degradation caused 
     by aggressive plants like English Ivy — a fast-spreading vine that chokes out native flora, disrupts 
     wildlife habitats, and weakens forest resilience. Through hands-on habitat restoration, ecological 
     education, and sustainable land stewardship, we strive to reconnect people with the natural heritage 
     of the Pacific Northwest and ensure its forests thrive for generations to come. </p>
